Unbalanced distribution of male and female students can be seen in some subjects
in Universities. Call to accept equal numbers of either gender have thus been 
concerned. From my perspective, it is less [empratical] to have control over the
gender scale.

Compulsively equaling the gender,on the one hand, may have detrimental impact on 
. It is widely acknowledged that some subject is more attractive for a certain 
gender.
