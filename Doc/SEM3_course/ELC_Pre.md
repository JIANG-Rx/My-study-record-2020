Good afternoon, everyone!  The topic of my thesis is Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. So what is that hypothesis? Basically, it assumes that our cognition is dependent on our native language, so that **different** language speakers think **differently**.

There are two reasons that I choose     this topic. First is that this topic is fairly **debateable**. In fact, it is one of the **core** theory of linguistics and it has been debated for around **50 years**. Another reason is that studying this topic will help us to better understand ourselves.~~So that it may enhance our ability such as cross-cultural communication.~~

In general there are three views on this theory. First is universalism, they believe that our cognition ability is **same**, so language will **not** affect our cognition. Second is relativism, they believe that language **will** affect our perception, but the effect is limited. Third is determinism, they claim that our perception is **totally dependent** on our language. 

In my passage, my stance is that this hypothesis stands at least for color cognition. That is to say, our color cognition is dependent on our native language. 

There are plenty of studies support this theory. For example, research found that Russian were faster to discriminate light blue and dark blue than English users. The reason is that there are two corresponding words for dark blue and light blue in Russian, while there is only one in English. So we can see from this example that, lexical discrepancy can lead to cognition difference. 

Critics claim that such a cognition difference is possibly caused by other factors such as culture, lifestyle and nationality. However, their view is mainly based on logical inference, and lack support. In fact, There are plenty of studies minimized other factors and has ruled out such possibility.

Recent technology such as MRI enabled us to keep track of brain activity. With the help of those techniques, we can have a clearer view on this hypothesis. 

To conclude, we can say that Sapir-Whorf hypothesis stands in the field of color cognition, but further research is needed to determine other fields. That's all. thanks.
