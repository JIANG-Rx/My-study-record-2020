1.	Can you drink seawater to survive if you don’t have any freshwater? Please explain based on the chemical properties of water molecules (Dr James Kar-Hei Fang)


2.	How does the solar energy correlate with hydro energy and wind power? Please explain this based on the origins of these sustainable energy (Dr Bolong Huang)


Answer 1: No, We cannot drink seawater to survive.

This is because seawater is salty, in other words, it is a solution of sodium chlorides ($NaCl$) and others compounds. The concentration of seawater is around 3.5%, while the concentration of Saline is 0.9%, so the concentration of $Na^+$ and $Cl^+$ in seawater is higher, and thus higher osmotic pressure.  By the property of water molecule, water will flow from low osmotic pressure to high osmotic pressure. Our cell membrane is semi-permeable, so out body fluid (water molecule) will flow out the cell if the concentration outside is higher. So it turn out that we cannot absorb the water molecule in seawater, but in turn lose water.


Answer 2:
Solar energy is (for most cases) the origin of hydro energy and wind power. Solar energy is in form of EM radiation, it heats our earth.

hydro power: To use Hydro power is to utilize the Gravity potential energy of water. Water flow from higher location to lower location, and then we use this to drive the generator. Solar radiation take important part in the water cycle. The radiation heats water, making them evaporate and form cloud, These cloud may move to high latitude area and then rain. So it is sun light that "lift" water to high place and thus let them have much gravity potential.


Wind power: The origin of wind is Temperature difference. Heated air go up(and expands) and cold air go down(and shrinks), then there comes different air pressure and subsequently wind formed. It is Solar radiation that heats the ground and creates temperature difference. Due to different specific heat capacity, temperature in different place is not even (e.g. seaside). Air in different temperature has different pressure (By Clapeyron equation) . Air will move form high pressure to low pressure in form of wind.
