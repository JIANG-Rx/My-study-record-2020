Task1:
    Source Codes:
        1: task1.cpp: Easy-mode computer player implementation. 
                      This easy A.I. is based on random function,
                      it will first attempt to place at center of

                      randomly play, and will win occasionally. 
    Sample Outputs:
        1: task1_SampleOut.pdf: Sample output for task1: implementing easy AI.
